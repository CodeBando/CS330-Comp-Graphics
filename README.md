#### How do I approach designing software and developing programs?
When approaching designing software and developing programs, I utilize many approaches to help me reach a successful completion of the project. The first approach is pre-planning. When approaching this work, I first decided on the scene that I wanted to recreate utilizing OpenGL. Once the scene had been chosen, I then reviewed the scene and aligned on the various components that would be needed to recreate it, identifing the shapes that would be utilized to create the various objects.

After the completing this step, I then moved on to wireframing of code. Mapping out the functions that would be needed to successfully build the scene allowed me to preplan the functions I would need to develop, the order in which I would develop them, and ensure that I am utilizing coding best practices and OOP design.

Once this was completed, I then iterated through the design, completing individual sections of the code, testing them, and then moving on to the next sections, retesting and repeating until the application is completed. This ensures that I am able to be efficient in my coding, capturing errors and defects early in the process and addressing them before the issues become unmanagable. 

This program forced me to introduce some additional strategies that I have not utilized before. One of those is iteration. In my past programs, the components I coded produced an end product that did not require me to iterate through different elements and make adjustments to get objects into the correct locations or apply textures that would be applied to an object the way I wanted them to. This required me to try different sizes, locations, rotation angles and photo manipulation to get the end product that I truly wanted. 

When first working in the 3D space, I was forced to iterate my design multiple times until I had a better grasp on what my updates would do to the scene. As I continued to add more components to the scene, I was able to learn and adopt my implementation to better suit my needs, adjust how data was being captured when creating object meshes and develop a process that allowed me to quickly and effectively add as many shapes as I desired to the scene with minimal effort.

#### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
When reviewing my goals, computer sciene is the stepping stone. When looking at my future educational pathways, it is opening to doors into new ways of thinking and approaches to designing and developing software and programs. While not every project I work on will utilize 3D space, the processes I went through to successfully execute the project can be utilized on all programs I work on. Iterating through design choices, developing functions to streamline my work, and my ability to preplan have all improved. 

When looking at my career or professional pathways, computational graphics has opened the door to possible career oppurtionities I was not aware of. This has helped broaden my scope of what is possible with computer science and the oppurtionities that are available to me.
